# First JAVA Project: Vacation Control System

## Theme and Description of Project

The Coca-Cola Company requires a program with a graphical user interface that must perform the calculation of the vacation days to which an employee is entitled, depending on their position and seniority in the company. For this purpose, the company has provided the following requirements.

## Requeriments

The program should contain three different interfaces for navigation between them, which are:

* Welcome Interface: 

    - The main and startup screen.

* Terms and Conditions Interface: 

    - The user's name that will accept or decline. The terms and conditions must appear somewhere in the interface, as this confirms that it is the same user who accepts the terms and conditions.

* Principal Screen Interface: 

    - Somewhere in the interface, the name of the user who accepted the terms and conditions must be displayed.

    - The user should be given the freedom to customize the graphical interface.

    - There should be an option to clear the fields and perform a new calculation.

    - There must be an option to return to the Welcome screen.

    - Implement a way to calculate the vacation days with the requested employee data.
